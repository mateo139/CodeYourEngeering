⚙ I am a graduate master of engineering, but in fact the biggest satisfaction is given me by building bridges between people and technology. That's why I love analyzing data, problems and the nature of physics!

📈 I have experience in developing IT tools for supporting sales and manufacturing processes using Excel/VBA. 

🖥️ I've cooperated not only with developers of web applications, ERP system and databases (Python/C#/SQL), but also with different specializations of engineers , as well as with sales departments and business owners.

❓ What can I provide in cooperation ?

➡ Analytical mindset in problem-solving, proved by engineering background.
➡ Good communication and presentation skills, proved by 9 years of experience in technical sales.
➡ Self-motivation to work independently, systematically, and effectively, proved by present and past roles.
➡ Self-development in the field of IT solutions, proved by great attitude to learn.
